Sleep Quality Predictor using Machine Learning

A Python-based machine learning application that predicts sleep quality (Good, Average, or Poor) based on daily lifestyle and sleep-related habits. The system also maintains a sleep history and visualizes trends over time.

Overview

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on synthetic sleep data to predict sleep quality. Users provide daily inputs such as bedtime, wake-up time, stress level, screen usage, and caffeine intake. Based on these factors, the model predicts sleep quality and offers basic suggestions.
